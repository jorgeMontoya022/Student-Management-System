# Student Management Project

The Student Management Project is an application designed to manage student information within an educational institution. The system allows for administrative tasks and maintenance of student-related data, such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing information.

## Main Features:
- **Student Management**: The administrator can add new students, edit their personal information (name, ID, email, phone), and delete students if necessary.
  
- **Search and Filter**: The system includes a search feature to filter students by name or ID, making it easier to locate students within large datasets.
  
- **Graphical User Interface**: The application has a user-friendly graphical interface with a table view to display the list of students and forms to add or update student information.

- **Course Management**: Although this module is under development, the system also includes functionality to assign courses to students. Administrators can register and manage courses and assign them to students as needed.

- **Data Storage**: The project uses an XML file to store all student and course information, simplifying management without the need for a complex SQL database.

- **User Roles**: Only the administrator has permissions to register students and courses, ensuring proper control over the stored information.

- **Validation and Security**: The system validates the entered data to avoid errors and ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used:
- JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
- FXML for UI creation.
- XML for persistent data storage.
- Java as the main programming language for the system's logic.

## Purpose:
The goal of this project is to facilitate student management in educational institutions by providing administrators with a simple yet robust tool to maintain and update student information and their relationship with courses.

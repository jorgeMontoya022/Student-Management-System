# 📚 Student Management Project

The **Student Management Project** is an application designed to manage student information within an educational institution. The system allows for administrative tasks and maintenance of student-related data, such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing information.

## ✨ Main Features:
- **👨‍🎓 Student Management**: The administrator can add new students, edit their personal information (name, ID, email, phone), and delete students if necessary.
- **🔍 Search and Filter**: The system includes a search feature to filter students by name or ID, making it easier to locate students within large datasets.
- **🖥️ Graphical User Interface**: The application has a user-friendly graphical interface with a table view to display the list of students and forms to add or update student information.
- **📋 Course Management**: Although this module is under development, the system also includes functionality to assign courses to students. Administrators can register and manage courses as needed.
- **💾 Data Storage**: The project uses an XML file to store all student and course information, simplifying management without the need for a complex SQL database.
- **🔐 User Roles**: Only the administrator has permissions to register students and courses, ensuring proper control over the stored information.
- **✅ Validation and Security**: The system validates the entered data to avoid errors and ensure data integrity.

## 💻 Technologies Used:
- 🖼️ **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface.
- 🎨 **FXML** for UI creation.
- 📂 **XML** for persistent data storage.
- ☕ **Java** as the main programming language for the system's logic.

## 🎯 Purpose:
The goal of this project is to facilitate student management in educational institutions by providing administrators with a simple yet robust tool to maintain and update student information and their relationship with courses.
